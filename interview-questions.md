# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: Parameter is something within the function that essentially holds data. So when you run the function and input the parameter the data held by it will get outputted. An argument can be understood as a statement that tells a function that when it holds a certain value then the function will return certain data.

  Researched answer: A parameter is a named variable passed into a function and are used to import arguments into functions. Arguments are the actual values passed into the function.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The built in method .map() takes the parameters from the array of a function. As to which are required and which are optional I will further research this topic to inform myself and explain in the space below.

  Researched answer: It takes a function definition, index, and an array as required parameters. Theres another parameter that is optional to the map function which is called "Overriding this" with a callbackFunction value that can callback value a from an old function to a new one.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: Map returns the same amount of values from an array and outputs the same amount back and the filter take values from an array and outputs less values by condensing the information.

  Researched answer: As stated in the syllabus a map function iterates through an array and returns a new array of the same length and the filter function loops through an array and returns a new array with only values that are true or satisfy a given condition within your function.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a set of data that outputs data based off the values within it and a method is an action performed on an object within a function.

  Researched answer: A function executes a set of instructions that perform a task and a method executes a set of instructions that perform a task associated with an object.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is essentially taking a part an object through use of a function by running a certain command.

  Researched answer: A syntax for extracting values from an object and assigning them to a new variable.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Not sure since we didn't go over it but I will educate myself and elaborate in the space below.

  Researched answer: The process where the interpreter appear to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope prior to executing the code.
